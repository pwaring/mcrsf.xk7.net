  <h2>Read</h2>
    <p><strong>Score:</strong> We score individually out of 5, and the value listed in the table is an average of the scores. Anything scoring 4 or above generally met with our approval. We don't have scores for some of the earlier books, and sometimes we have the author attend for a Q&A - in those cases we don't always score the book.</p>
    <p><strong>Score Type:</strong> We try to choose something amusing to score out of which is related to the book.</p>
