  <h2>Rejected</h2>
    <p>Rejected books are ones which have been suggested but we've decided not to read. Common reasons for rejection are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Length:</strong> Maximum of 400 pages, as we find that people don't have the time to read longer books.</li>
      <li><strong>Genre:</strong> We're a sci-fi book club rather than sci-fi and fantasy.</li>
      <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Must have an eBook and paperback at a reasonable price (generally less than Â£10). We don't usually read books that are out of print or only in hardback.</li>
      <li><strong>Advocate:</strong> Whoever suggests the book usually takes the lead in the discussion. If no one is willing to do this then we tend to reject the book.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Rejection means that we don't think the book is a good fit for our club, not that it's a bad book or that we don't recommend reading it. For example, several members have read and enjoyed Children of Time, but at 600 pages it's too long for the club.</p>
