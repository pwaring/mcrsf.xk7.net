  <h2>{{ section|title }}</h2>
  {% if section == 'rejected' %}
    <p>Rejected books are ones which have been suggested but we've decided not to read. Common reasons for rejection are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Length:</strong> Maximum of 400 pages, as we find that people don't have the time to read longer books.</li>
      <li><strong>Genre:</strong> We're a sci-fi book club rather than sci-fi and fantasy.</li>
      <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Must have an eBook and paperback at a reasonable price (generally less than Â£10). We don't usually read books that are out of print or only in hardback.</li>
      <li><strong>Advocate:</strong> Whoever suggests the book usually takes the lead in the discussion. If no one is willing to do this then we tend to reject the book.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Rejection means that we don't think the book is a good fit for our club, not that it's a bad book or that we don't recommend reading it. For example, several members have read and enjoyed Children of Time, but at 600 pages it's too long for the club.</p>
  {% elseif section == 'read' %}
    <p><strong>Score:</strong> We score individually out of 5, and the value listed in the table is an average of the scores. Anything scoring 4 or above generally met with our approval. We don't have scores for some of the earlier books, and sometimes we have the author attend for a Q&A - in those cases we don't always score the book.</p>
    <p><strong>Score Type:</strong> We try to choose something amusing to score out of which is related to the book.</p>
  {% elseif section == 'suggestions' %}
    <p>These books have been suggested by one or more members of the group, or on social media. A book being listed here doesn't mean that we will definitely read it - the list is to allow us to remember what books we've suggested already.</p>
  {% elseif section == 'upcoming' %}
    <p>These are the next few books we are planning to read and have set a date for - though occasionally we will move books around if publication is delayed or the person advocating the book can't make it.</p>
